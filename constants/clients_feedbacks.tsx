        `Iâ€™ve contacted SHAPED on a number of occasions to source items that were incredibly hard to find in any of the London boutiques.`,
        `Once I sent across the items, they were quick to respond confirming they would be able to help and provided an approximate lead time, with this they were also transparent about the fee for the service.`,
        `Once I agreed they got to work! And my items were ready for collection. `,
        `I was very happy with the service and am I repeat customer thank you guys so much!`

        `I canâ€™t recommend Kizz and Shaped enough! She really came through for me and my wife for our weddingâ€”helping us with everything from picking the designs and materials to handling the tailoring. She just gets it. She knew the right fittings, what worked for us, and made sure everything looked perfect. `,
        `What I love most is how she pushes me out of my comfort zone in the best way. Iâ€™ve worn things I never wouldâ€™ve considered before, and now I actually love them. Sheâ€™s also got a sharp eye for deals and constantly sends me links to great finds onlineâ€”stuff I probably wouldâ€™ve missed otherwise.`,
        `Plus, sheâ€™s always there when I need her. Whether itâ€™s last-minute outfit advice for a holiday trip or gift ideas, she comes through every time. God knows how many last-minute requests Iâ€™ve thrown at herâ€”too many to count, lol. But sheâ€™s so reliable, stylish, and just makes everything so easy and stress-free. Honestly, 10/10`,

        `I never thought that using a stylist would be beneficial to me as I've been so used to doing everything by myself.`,
        `However, a situation came up where I had multiple events across the second half of the year and I was struggling to find outfits for all of them at the same time. I was recommended Shaped services by a friend of mine and I reached out to them and we had a conversation. After the consultation, it became very clear to me that my approach to looking for outfits for myself was very haphazard and unorganised. Shaped services helped me to find suitable outfit options within my budget to the time frame including tailoring and delivery.`,
        `In a situation that could become awkward, it was really comfortable for me to talk to the team and ask for what I needed without being pushed back as well as being told what would actually suit me. Using Shaped services allowed me to step out of my comfort zone and find looks that I necessarily wouldn't have selected for myself. I am indebted to them and I will continue to sing their praises and use their services going forward and I recommend to you that you should use them too. Professional as well as thorough Shaped services are a blessing.`

        `Working with Kizzy as my personal shopper was a game-changer for my style and confidence. Her expert eye for fashion, attention to detail, and understanding of my unique preferences made every shopping experience effortless and enjoyable. The curated outfits that fit my personality, body type, and lifestyle perfectly, saving me time and eliminating the stress of shopping. I now have a wardrobe filled with pieces I love, and I feel more put-together than ever. I highly recommend Kizzy for anyone looking to transform their style or streamline their shopping experience.`,
